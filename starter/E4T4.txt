# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Eliminate all outside SSH access to the EC2 instances and just AWS Systems manager.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No. An attacker could gain access via other means such through VPC and use the insecure IAM permissions.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. Only data that was submitted after the encryption was enabled.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
It would introduce a lot of security vulnerabilities.
